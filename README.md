# opencensus-go-exporter-azuremonitor

Azure Monitor helps developers and customers to monitor their application.
As part of the whole story, we want to collect monitoring/instrumentation data from popular open source 
technologies.
This project aims to support all OpenCensus SDKs piping data to Azure Monitor through the OneAgent.

This is still in early development.
